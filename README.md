# Domino-dashboard
This project was done to gain insights into domino's pizza sales from 2018 to 2020.
##ABOUT THE DATASET

The Sales data contains the Transaction ID, Date, Branch, Pizza, Unit Price, Quantity, and Sales Discount.

##BUSINESS PROBLEM

#To Identify:

•	Which branch generated the highest sales.
•	What are our best and worst selling pizzas?
•	Which year was profitable and unprofitable?
•	How order trended on quarterly basis.
•	How order trended by months and days.
•	What time is the peak hours?
•	Which unit price has more order?
•	How many flavors of pizza is on the menu?

##TOOL USED: POWER BI

I performed the ETL process (Extraction, Transformation and Loading). I extracted the sales data and transformed it using Power Query where I checked for possible errors, I removed null and duplicate values.
I created new columns to calculate for Discounted Price by multiplying unit price*sales discount, Gross Revenue was generated by multiplying unit price*quantity and Sales Price by Multiplying unit price*quantity-sales discount.
I created new measures to calculate the Total Gross Revenue, Total Discounted Price and Total Sales Price, total order and total quantity. I filtered unit price to check for the total number of orders per price.  
After which I loaded the sales data into the power bi desktop.

##DOMINO’S PIZZA 2018-2020 SALES DASHBOARD

I used card on the power bi desktop to display the total gross revenue, total discounted price, total sales price, total order and total quantity. I used slicer to display unit price and pizza. 
I used line charts to check for how orders trended on quarterly basis. I also used line charts to check how monthly and days trended by orders.
Line chart was used to detect the peak hours.
I used stacked column chart to check which branch generated the highest sales.
Clustered bar chart was used to check for bestselling pizzas while multi row card was used to check for worst selling pizzas.
Donut chart was used to check for which year was profitable and unprofitable.

##INSIGHTS

Lekki branch has more sales than the other branches, this may be due to lot of recreation centres and industrial company compared to the other branches. There is just a little difference in sales between Gbagada and Ibadan. Surulere is the branch with the lowest sales.
2018 and 2019 generate more sales than 2020. The sales difference between 2018 and 2020 was 286,795k. Sales in 2020 drastically dropped, this could be because of COVID-19.
Most Customers ordered 3000-unit price compare to 2000- and 4000-unit price. Order for 2000-unit price was 1496 while 4000-unit price has 2178 order compared to 3000 unit price of 996, 325 orders.
Margarita and Beef Suya were the most ordered pizza while Extravaganza and Chicken Suya were the least ordered pizza.
The peak hours are 1:27:50PM with a sale of 34,850,908.42M because this is usually the lunch time hour for most organizations and 3:20:09PM with 34,665,904.01M sales.
March recorded the highest orders of 112k and November recorded the lowest order of 72k.
The 1st Quarter recorded the highest orders.

##RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the analysis, Domino's Pizza should focus on increasing sales in branches with lower sales volume. 
The company can introduce new pizza flavors to diversify their menu and attract more customers and focus more on the production of 3000-unit price.
They should consider offering discounts during off-peak hours or days to increase sales without sacrificing profit.
The company should increase the production of margarita and beef suya during those peak hours to meet customer demand and drop pizza with least order.
The company should also consider expanding their menu to include holiday-themed items.
Additionally, extending the hours of operation during the holiday season to accommodate the increase in customer traffic.
